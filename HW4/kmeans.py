#Each row in the data set is a 28x28 pixel representation of a digit
#30,000 rows


#1, implement K-means algorithm with k = 2, plot the objective (SSE) as a function of iterations.
#Present results of a typical run.


#pick k values randomly, 0-29999. for each value, find nearest k and store for that k
#Find the mean of these points, and the point closes to this mean. This is the new k location
#Iterate 



#2, Apply this implementation with different values of k {3..10} For each k, please run the alg. 10 times.
